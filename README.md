# AAI-501_Team-AI-7 (AI Based Lane Detaction)
This project is a part of the AAI_500_Group7 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD) with the objective of developing an end-to-end statistical analysis of a dataset.

The automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transformation, with autonomous vehicles at the forefront of technological advancement. As self-driving cars become increasingly sophisticated, accurate lane detection emerges as a critical component for ensuring safe and efficient navigation.  Modern vehicles are becoming increasingly reliant on advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) . Accurate lane detection is critical in these systems, ensuring that vehicles stay within their designated lanes. Traditionally post-processing techniques have been employed for achieving the task of lane detection. While post-processing techniques help with detection accuracy, they often lack robustness and scalability. They are limited in the detection of only a limited number of lanes, which affects the decision-making algorithm to efficiently change the lanes as the vehicle navigates. This project focuses on developing an automated lane detecting system which utilizes the advanced Deep learning methods to develop models that are capable of pixel-wise lane segmentation and lane Classification to detect lanes. This is achieved by ERFNet and LCNet which are efficient CNN Models.
