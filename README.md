# AAI-501_Team-AI-7 (AI-Based Lane Detection)
This project is a part of the AAI_500_Group7 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD) to develop an AI-based Lane Detection model.

## Project Status: [Under Progress]

# Abstract :
This project aims to study and develop a robust and accurate lane detection model using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This model will help in automatically detecting a lane by taking inputs from the camera of the vehicle, as lane detection is a key feature of self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems. The input frames from the camera are the inputs that help us to understand the environment of the vehicle. Training of the model would be done by feeding thousands of images of public roads from selected datasets using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based algorithms. The model would identify the expected outputs such as lane markings, lane boundaries, crossings in lanes, and the number of lines.
